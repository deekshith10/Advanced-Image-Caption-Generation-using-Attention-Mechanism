# Advanced-Image-Caption-Generation-using-Attention-Mechanism
The project intricately involves an interaction between computer vision and natural language processing, leveraging advanced neural network architectures. We used the Flickr8k dataset from Kaggle

The challenge focuses on refining the encoder-decoder architecture, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) play a pivotal role in extracting salient features from images. These features are then passed to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, orchestrating the generation of captions.
The integration of attention mechanisms is a groundbreaking contribution, enabling dynamic focus on different areas of an image during caption generation, thereby improving the quality and relevance of descriptions.
